# Erlang Concrete Data Types

This is a library that does parsing and validation in Erlang of some commonly used input types.

The first type to be parsed in this way will be a South African ID number.

To compile, export the ERL_LIBS environment variable:

    export ERL_LIBS=/path/to/basedir/proper # below this is include/proper.hrl
